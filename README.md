Fintech 

1) Insurance companies provide products that include OPD solutions. 

2) We are working on a technology solution for the customer and the medical service provider for a seamless digital interaction. 

3) The solution will also enable customers for a cashless solution and make the process seamless.

Automation:

Simply Checkout/return (RFID):

1) Instead of having a librarian check your books in or out, drop them in an RFID reader enabled box to return them. 

2) Post this result live to the library's servers so people can see when books have been returned before they are processed at the end of a day by a librarian.

3) That way a user could specifically request a book that has been returned, but is not yet on the shelves. You could even bill them for overdue charges as they returned the book with Stripe!
